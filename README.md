Language Coverage Matrix - Dashboard (lcm-dashboard)
====================================================

The Language Coverage Matrix Dashboard is a visualization of the data about language coverage in Wikimedia Projects.


This project is a Wikimedia Foundation initiative to present information about the availability of language tools for various languages in the Wikimedia universe and to track their progress. 


Language Coverage Matrix
------------------------

The Matrix document contains information about the languages that are currently covered across various Wikimedia projects. 

1. src/project-langdb.csv - This file contains information about the languages in which Wikipedia or any other Wikimedia project exists
2. src/incubator-langdb.csv - This file contains information about the languages which are present in the incubator and do not have any active Wikimedia projects.

These files are periodically reviewed and updated.

Language Coverage Dashboard
---------------------------

The Language Coverage dashboard will be a visual representation of the Matrix data. It will provide features to:

1. search languages
2. query information about the features available
3. compare language coverage over a period of time
4. visually present information
